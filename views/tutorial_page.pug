                        p Realistic style produces less stylized result, while artistic style maximizes the style. Low quality is faster but might produce visual artifacts, while high quality takes more time to suppress visual artifacts. If you are not sure, it's recommended to use default value.

                        p.info How long does it take?
                        p The time it takes is decided by the resolution of both content image and style image, and process quality. The higher the resolution or quality, the longer it takes. For example, 512x512 images with quality set to "normal" take about 10 seconds to render, while 1920x1080 images with same quality might take up to 1 minute.
